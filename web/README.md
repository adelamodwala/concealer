# React CMS Frontend

In development - a React/Redux front-end to be used with a CMS backend (for now just Wordpress).

Credit: This repo is using the [@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon) boilerplate at https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-boilerplate - it's freaking awesome!

Stay tuned for more updates!
